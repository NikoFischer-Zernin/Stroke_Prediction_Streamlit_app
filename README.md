# Stroke Prediction Streamlit App
This app is the product of a group project for university and was designed to predict Stroke risks for the users inputs.
It is based on a dataset retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lirilkumaramal/heart-stroke).
As Model we chose a Random Forest Regressor.

We tried to make it usable in the Insurance Industry so we built in a Premium Class Classifier.
The app is able to predict the stroke risk on the base of specified user inputs as well as uploaded DataFrames.

When predicting the specified user inputs, it can return a graph showing the future risk of the user, depending on the age.

On the other hand, when dealing with DataFrames, the User is able to download the original Dataset with the insurance classificaiton or the Modified DataFrame with the original Predictions appended.
