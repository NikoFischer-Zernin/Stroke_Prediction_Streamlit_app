# Stroke Prediction Streamlit App
This app is the product of a group project for university and was designed to predict Stroke risks for the users inputs.
It is based on a dataset retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lirilkumaramal/heart-stroke).
As Model we chose a Random Forest Regressor.

The app is able to predict the stroke risk on the base of specified user inputs as well as uploaded DataFrames.

We tried to make it usable in the Insurance Industry so we built in a Premium Class Classifier.
